The reward amount depends on the edition of Google Workspace that the user selects, as listed in the commission table. How does the promotion code discount work? When you join the program, we�ll send you an email with your referral link and promotion codes so your referrals can save on their first year. Each promotion code can only be used by one referral. You will be eligible to receive up to 100 promotion codes each year. Promotion codes cannot be posted publicly. They must be distributed to each referral on an individual basis. What�s the difference between the Referral Program and the Affiliate Program? The Referral Program is best for those looking to refer up to 99 users per year. The Affiliate Program is designed for higher volume referrers (those who refer at least 100 users per year). Those who fit the qualifications of the Affiliate Program will receive additional perks beyond what the Referral Program offers, like higher commission rates for each new user referred, 1:1 account support, promotional resources, and more.
