Encryption Encryption keeps data private and secure while in transit Encryption brings a higher level of security and privacy to our services. When you send an email, share a video, visit a website or store your photos, the data that you create moves between your device, Google services and our data centres. We protect this data with multiple layers of security, including leading encryption technology such as HTTPS and Transport Layer Security. Security alerts Proactive security alerts help protect your private information We�ll proactively notify you if we detect something that we think you should know about, like a suspicious login or a malicious website, file or app, and we�ll provide guidance to help you strengthen your security. For example, on Gmail, we�ll warn you before you download an attachment that could put your security at risk or if someone logs in to your account from a device not associated with you. When we detect something suspicious in your account, we�ll send a notification to your inbox or phone so that you can protect your account with one click. Blocking bad ads Blocking malicious and misleading ads before they get to you Your online experience can be affected and your security compromised by ads that carry malware, cover the content that you are trying to see, promote fake products or otherwise violate our advertising policies. We take this problem very seriously. Every year we block billions of bad ads � on average, 100 per second � through a combination of live reviewers and sophisticated software. We also give you tools to report offensive ads and control what types of ads you see. And we actively publish our insights and best practices to help make the Internet safer for all.
