Shortly after the assassination, Whitman hastily wrote the first of his Lincoln poems, "Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day". Two more appeared in his collection Sequel to Drum-Taps later in 1865: "O Captain! My Captain!" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd". The poems—particularly "My Captain!"—were popular upon publication and, in the following years, Whitman styled himself as an interpreter of Lincoln. In 1871, his fourth poem on Lincoln, "This Dust Was Once the Man", was published. "My Captain!" is still one of Whitman's most popular works, despite slipping in popularity and critical assessment since the early 1900s. "Lilacs" is often listed as one of Whitman's finest works.

Made of metal sheets riveted into a triangular prism, it was unlawfully placed on public land between July and October 2016, and stood unnoticed for more than four years until its discovery and removal in late 2020. The identity of its makers, and their objectives, are unknown. Following its discovery, numerous similar metal columns, many of which were built by local artists as deliberate imitations, were erected in other places throughout the world. This photograph shows the Utah monolith at its original location. Photograph credit: Patrick A. Mackie; retouched by Chainwit.
